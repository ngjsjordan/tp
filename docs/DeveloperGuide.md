### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1` in order to delete the first person in the displayed list.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Appointments

#### Overall Design Considerations:

In planning our design for appointments, we aimed to 
- minimise coupling between new classes added
- maximise cohesion in new classes added and keeping to the design styles present in the existing `Model`.
- make it easily convertible to Json for the `Storage` component.  

We prioritised these factors over implementing the most efficient solution possible as our NFRs did not outline a need to support a data volume large enough such that it would make a major difference. In the event that these requirements became necessary, a good core design would be more easily extensible.

We finalised on the design present in our product before the MVP release. This can be found in [this part](#model-component) of the Architecture section. Of particular note are:

- A unidirectional coupling from `Appointment` to `Person`. We decided that this would suffice, eliminating the need to maintain data integrity if a bidirectional relationship were required. We accepted this tradeoff of reduced coupling for decreased efficiency (to modify a person’s appointments, you would need to look at all appointments to find matches) in line with our design goals. This could be modified in the future if the necessity arises.
- Two distinct associations between `Person` and `Appointment` rather than a single association with multiplicity 2. This is to delineate the distinct buyer and seller roles in an appointment. We gauged that the extra effort to implement a more generalised approach would not be required within the scope of this project. This approach has been outlined in the Future Extensions appendix.
- `AppointmentDatetime` is a separate class. This keeps the design similar to that of `Person`, where even attribute fields like `Name` are modelled as a separate class.
- `buyer` is optional. This feature was not present in the MVP, but we thought that it would be useful to have (perhaps an initial assessment of a property). It would also be possible to make seller optional, but we thought that that would have more niche utility and so didn’t include it.
- Within the `Appointment` class and relevant `Logic` classes (`Parser`, `Command`), the null values are handled internally, with any external exposure making use of Java's `Optional`. This helps to reduce the possibility of having a `NullPointerException`.
- `Person`'s phone number (`Phone`) is made unique. This allows us to store only the phone number of the persons involved in each appointment, removing the possibility of conflicts and increasing the ease of manual editing (for advanced users).

#### Add Appointment

Add appointment (`ap`) allows users to insert a new `Appointment`, with the following parameters:
- `appointmentDatetime`, which is of class `AppointmentDatetime`.
- `seller`, which is of class `Person`.
- `buyer`, which is of class `Person` and can be `null`.

The user passes these parameters in using the prefixes `d/` (datetime), `s/` (seller) and `b/` (buyer).

The `Parser` class for this command helps to convert the input strings into objects to be manipulated.
- The string passed into `d/` is converted directly into the required `AppointmentDatetime` with the help of the `ParserUtil` class.
- The strings passed into `s/` and `b/` are converted (also with `ParserUtil`'s help) into the `Index` abstraction used to represent the index of the requested person in the last shown list. 

These objects are passed into a new `Command` object. This has an overloaded constructor to handle the cases of `buyer` being `null` or otherwise. 

When the `execute` method is executed, 
- the `lastShownList` of Persons is obtained from `Model`.
- the `lastShownList` is asked for the required persons using the `Index` objects. This returns the `Person` objects needed for `seller` and `buyer`.
- finally, the actual `Appointment` is created using the one or two `Person` objects and one `AppointmentDatetime` object, again utilising an overloaded constructor.

The following simplified sequence diagram outlines the main operations of `AddAppointmentCommand::execute`.

![ApCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram](images/ApCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th client in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new client. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the client was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the client being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Effort**

**Difficulty Level**: Medium. The code base was not trivial, but was relatively easy to understand and extend once we got the hang of it. Most of the thought processes behind the features concerned not how they can be technically implemented, but rather how they should be designed in line with the code quality guidelines and existing architecture of AB3. Our codebase increases the complexity of the class structure by having a new entity type (Appointment) that creates relationships amongst the existing entity type (Person), the commands and fields to support those relationships, as well as additional fields and functionality for user convenience.

**Challenges Faced**: The timeline was a bit challenging at times. The first few weeks coincided with the busy midterms period, increasing the overall workload (albeit the deadlines were more lax then). The fact that weekly deadlines fell on Thursday rather than a more conventional Sunday also increased the strain a bit, as it was more difficult to fit our individual schedules.

**Effort Required**: On average, we spent about 10 hours per week on the project per person, slightly above average for a 4MC course including lecture and tutorials. We opted not to overextend ourselves implement features that would be too complex, instead implementing simple but useful features instead. Our product hence does not have an appearance that deviates too much from AB3, and we were roughly in accordance with the 50% iP effort guidelines.

**Achievements**: We evolved AB3 into an application tailored for the use of a specific audience (property agents), by extending the existing contact management features with new ones that would be specifically useful for our audience, such as the ability to create and track appointments with clients, or the ability to store and search by more industry-specific information such as property type. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
Team Size: 5
1. **Support multiple properties per seller**. Currently, each seller only has one associated property (stored in the `Address` field), limiting the app's functionality for agents managing seller portfolios with multiple properties.
   - We plan to enhance the feature to support multiple properties per seller by modifying `Person` to hold a `List` of `Address` in a separate `Properties` field. This would cover the case where the Person's actual home address is not one of the properties they wish to sell (common in multi-property portfolios).
   - The property lists would be managed by separate `prop`, `eprop`, `dprop` commands to prevent the existing Person-related commands from being overloaded with responsibility.
   - Appointments would also hold a specific `Address` rather than taking the seller's address.
1. **Role to be allocated per appointment instead of person**. Currently, a `Role` is assigned to a `Person` based on their general status (looking to buy or sell). This limits the usefulness of the field in filtering or searching users as part of their role in appointments.
   - We plan to enhance this feature by making `Role` an association class between `Appointment` and `Person`. A `RoleType` enum would hold the types of roles available (buyer, seller, or future extensions like lessor/lessee). The `Role` class would then hold fields of `RoleType`, `Appointment` and `Person`, and can be interacted with via `UniqueRoleList`.
   - This would allow for more flexible appointments (more than 1 buyer/seller), especially in combination with enhancement 1, improve searchability (search appointments by role of person etc.), and feature extensibility (more role types). 
1. **Filter appointments by custom time range**. Currently, users can only filter appointments by predefined timeframes (`past`, `today`, `upcoming`) using the `sap` command. This limits flexibility when agents need to view appointments within a specific date or time range.
   - We plan to enhance the search appointment feature to allow users to specify custom time ranges using parameters like `from/` and `to/`.
   - Example usage: `sap from/2025-11-01T00:00 to/2025-11-30T23:59` to list all appointments in November 2025.
   - This will provide agents with more precise control over viewing appointments for specific periods, such as weekly schedules, monthly reviews, or custom date ranges for reports. 
1. **Detailed feedback messages**. Currently, the feedback string contained within `CommandResult` cannot be further modified once created. This limits the ability of the application to give detailed feedback that comes from multiple sources (e.g. multiple appointment deletions on client deletion), warnings on successful but potentially undesirable inputs (e.g. appointments being created in the past), or more detailed feedback regarding the specifics of errors (e.g. which field caused a duplicate entry).
   - We plan to extend `CommandResult` with new supporting classes such as `ModelResult` so that each operation done in the model can output specific success/warning/error messages that can together construct the final `CommandResult`. This would allow the users to receive better feedback from the application such that it is easier to use.
1. **More comprehensive search logic**. Currently, the `find` and `sap` commands use OR logic for all keywords regardless of whether they belong to the same field or different fields. For example, `find Alice HDB_3` searches for clients with name containing "Alice" OR property type "HDB_3", which may return too many results including clients that only match one criterion.
   - We plan to enhance the search functionality to use AND logic when keywords are from different fields, while maintaining OR logic for keywords within the same field.
   - For example, `find Alice Bob HDB_3` would search for clients with (name containing "Alice" OR "Bob") AND (property type "HDB_3"), providing more precise results.
   - Similarly, `sap tf/upcoming Bernice Charlotte` would search for appointments with (name containing "Bernice" OR "Charlotte") AND (timeframe is "upcoming").
   - This will allow agents to perform more targeted searches by combining multiple criteria, making it easier to find specific clients or appointments that meet all specified requirements.
1. **Display person list alongside appointment list in split view**. Currently, users can only view either the appointment list (via `lap`) or the person list (via `list`) at any given time. This creates a troublesome workflow when using the `eap` command, which requires knowing indices from both lists simultaneously. Users must repeatedly switch between views to gather the required appointment index, seller index, and buyer index.
   - We plan to enhance the UI layout to display both the person list and appointment list simultaneously in a split-screen view.
   - The main window would be divided vertically, with the person list on the left side and the appointment list on the right side, each occupying approximately 50% of the window width.
   - Both lists would remain independently scrollable and retain their current card-based display format.
   - Commands like `list`, `find`, and `lap` would continue to work as before, updating their respective list panels.
   - Example: When a user executes `lap`, the appointment list updates on the right while the person list remains visible on the left, allowing users to see both "1. Alex Yeoh..." in the person list and "1. 2025-01-15 10:00..." in the appointment list simultaneously when preparing an `eap 1 s/1 b/2` command.
   - This enhancement eliminates the need to switch between views, significantly improving usability for appointment management commands while maintaining all existing functionality.
